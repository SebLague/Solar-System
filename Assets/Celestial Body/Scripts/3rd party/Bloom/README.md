Effect Properties
-----------------

![Inspector](http://i.imgur.com/glShkW3.png)

- **Threshold** - Filters out pixels under this level of brightness. This value
  should be given in the gamma space (as used in the color picker).

- **Soft Knee** - Makes transition between under/over-threshold gradual (0 =
  hard threshold, 1 = soft threshold).

- **Intensity** - Total intensity of the effect.

- **Radius** - Controls the extent of veiling effects. The value is not related
  to screen size and can be controlled in a resolution-independent fashion.

- **High Quality** - Controls the filter quality and the buffer resolution. On
  mobile platforms, it might strongly affect the performance of the effect,
  therefore itâ€™s recommended to be unchecked when running on mobile devices.

- **Anti Flicker** - Sometimes the effect introduces strong flickers (flashing
  noise). This option is used to suppress them with a noise reduction filter.
